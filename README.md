Some Basic Projects of Arduino
Model 1-  A temp module on tinkercad which display the temp on an lcd along with contrast controls. Along with that  PIR sensor for home automation. So when the temp exceeds 65 degrees, fan connected to a motor turns on  and if the pir senses an object near it, buzzer turns on.

Model 2- A DIP Switch SPST x6 in tinkercad to design a lock system. if unlocked shows the key else the screen should be blank. Apart from this it also connect an RGB led which remains red and turns green on unlocking.

Model 3- A program on Arduino 1 and Arduino 2  a circuit to blink a LED (connected to Arduino 2). The 2 Arduinos are connected such that Arduino 1 holds the pin 5 of Arduino 2 high for 50ms after every 3 second period. The Arduino 2 on receiving the signal from Arduino 1 holds the LED high for 1 second and then pulls it down.

Model 4- A code on Arduino 1 and Arduino 2 to send the last four digits of your ID number from Arduino 1 to Arduino 2. The Arduino 1 on receiving the digits displays them on the LCD screen connected to the Arduino 2.The communication protocol for data transfer between the Arduinos is be I2C.
